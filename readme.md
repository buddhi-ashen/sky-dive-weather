# sky dive weather forecast application

<b>A weather forecast application build using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and JQUEREY.</b>
this is the weather application I create, I use Unsplash API and open weather API to get random background and weather data. API keys are not revealed to the clients because of the proxy server. the newest feature is the auto-suggest function built by using jquery. https://sky-dive.herokuapp.com/
